# Movie-Rating-Prediction
📖 Overview

This project is part of my Codsoft internship and focuses on predicting movie ratings using machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to analyze historical movie data to estimate ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors.

🚀 Features
* Analyze and preprocess historical movie data.
* Explore relationships between features and ratings.
* Build and evaluate a regression-based prediction model.
* Gain insights into factors influencing movie ratings.

🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python: Programming language.
* Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
* Scikit-learn: Machine learning model development.

🧠 Steps Involved
* Data Analysis: Understand and visualize key trends in the data.
* Feature Engineering: Prepare and preprocess features for the model.
* Model Building: Use regression algorithms to predict ratings.
* Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.

🌟 Key Learnings
* Effective data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
* Applying regression techniques for real-world problems.
